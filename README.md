# System Logs Anomaly Detection using Fine-Tuned LLMs

As software systems continue to grow, the volume of logs generated has also increased exponentially, making real
time analysis of logs a crucial aspect in maintaining a stable and reliable system. Existing systems rely on predefined
patterns which are explicitly programmed or trained to identify a certain kind of anomaly pattern, making it
unreliable against unseen issues and needs manual intervention. This project aims to develop fine-tuned Large
Language Models (LLMs), where we use its natural language understanding capabilities to classify logs as 'normal'
or 'anomalous' without relying on predefined rules or patterns. We will also explore the computational cost, tradeoffs
and practicality of LLM based anomaly detection in real time log analysis, by comparing it to widely adopted
existing techniques. We propose a system that scales along with the evolving system with improved accuracy and
minimal human interference.
